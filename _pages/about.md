I will be pursuing a second master's degree at Sinapore Management University (SMU) from August 2024, under the Master of Science in Quantitative Finance (MQF) Programme. Currently, I am preparing for FRM and plan to start a career in Risk Management / Analysis. My resume is [here](/files/zhangyonghan_cv.pdf).
